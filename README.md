# Junior Full-Stack Developer

### ABOUT ME 🙋‍♀️
Hi there! 👋  I'm Alina from Russia, but I have Dutch permanent residence permit.
I currently living in Wormer, North Holland.

Ever since school, I wanted to work in IT, so I even entered the university for an IT specialty. 
I have a Master’s degree in computer since.

In 2014 I left Russia. Before the Netherlands, I lived in Bahrain for 2 years.
There I began to study English and web development.

In the Netherlands, I continued to study English and develop myself in web development.
I also started learning the Dutch language.
I have been living in the Netherlands for a little over 5 years.

For personal reasons, I did not have a chance to work in my field. 
But I keep hoping that someday I'll be a real developer.
