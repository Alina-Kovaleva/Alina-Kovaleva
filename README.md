### ABOUT ME 🙋‍♀️
Hi there! 👋  I'm Alina, born in Kyrgyzstan, raised in Russia and living in the Netherlands for almost 6 years.

Ever since school, I wanted to work in IT, so I even entered the university for an IT specialty. 
I have a Master’s degree in computer since.

For personal reasons, I did not have a chance to work in my field. 
But I keep hoping that someday I'll be a professional developer.

My main focus is in front-end development, I’m currently learning everything and loving it
💼 Open to work and ready to learn
